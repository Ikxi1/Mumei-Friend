Texture/Material Notes:
- Make and Emissive Texture for the text, that you can animate between to make it "come to life"
	- Needs bloom in Eevee, maybe Volumetrics in Cycles - Glare node in compositing
- Blinking face when it comes to life
- Make inside of the Texture as separate material and have it green, also with dirt
	- nah
- give the model some specular/metalness and add roughness to the textures, so not all reflects the same
	- need to inspect if the Roughness works - it does work, but increase it, by a lot
- Might have to redo UDIM workflow and change it to single images, still can export as UDIM, just in blender single images
	- currently not, but keep this solution in mind for the future
	- redo all of UV and texturing, because it's fucked - make roughness better in process - also already do bevel
	- 2x2 udim map
	- one layer messy fibers 3, balance .16 , contrast .09
	- one layer 3d perlin noise fractal, position .3 , contrast .17 , scale 3.03
	- one layer crystal 2, balance .28 , contrast .51 , scale 3 , disorder .39
	
	- still some things to improve, colour, crinkles, roughness
- Put Roughness on the rune mask export, so that there is still some in the render, metalness not needed
- ZIP THE .SPP FILE ON THE LAPTOP AND PUSH IT
- Do not use Roughness anymore, only use Metalness, it's better than Roughness

Modelling Notes:
- Shape keys to blinking animation and then animate each blink in UV too, try to animate UV by redoing UV mapping 
	- IT FUCKING WORKS HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
- Make sprites with vector, then export vector into blender and boolean out the face with vector instead of moving all the time
	- Fuck the thing above doesn't work with shape keys, try it anyway and see what happens
	- It might be possible, if all the eyes have, then same amount of vertices
- Add more geometry to the model, so it can be deformed later

Lighting Notes:
- Download Lighting chapter from cgboost - WATCHED
- Volumetric lighting on Friend
- Use keylights for the inside (lightning boy studio shader)
- Make spot light source not visible in reflection
- Use forest moody hdri, otherwise goddamn reflections just won't appear kon

Compositing Notes:
- Download compositing chapter from cgboost - you're fucking stupid, there is no compositing chapter

Animation Notes:
- animate diffuse or power in lights when Friend "comes to life"

Rendering Notes:
- Render with compositing and just diffuse colour
	- Add metadata to diffuse colour
- Log colour
