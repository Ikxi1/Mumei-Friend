Texture/Material Notes:
- Make and Emissive Texture for the text, that you can animate between to make it "come to life"
- Blinking face when it comes to life
- Make inside of the Texture as separate material and have it green, also with dirt
- give the model some specular/metalness and add roughness to the textures, so not all reflects the same
- Might have to redo UDIM workflow and change it to single images, still can export as UDIM, just in blender single images

Modelling Notes:
- Shape keys to blinking animation and then animate each blink in UV too, try to animate UV by redoing UV mapping 
IT FUCKING WORKS HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
